<strong>
* Following the amendment of Annex III of Regulation (EC) 1925/2006 as regards monacolins from red yeast rice, by which monacolins have been placed in Part B of Annex III, under ‘Restricted substances’, the use of monacolins from red yeast rice at levels of 3mg and more per portion of the product recommended for daily consumption is prohibited.
Consequently, the health claim on monacolin K from red yeast rice related to the contribution to the maintenance of normal blood cholesterol levels, under the daily intake of 10 mg of monacolin K from red yeast rice (Entry ID: 1648, 1700), can no longer be used and will be removed from the Union list of permitted health claims

Zeaxanthin ist ein wichtiges antioxidativ zellschützender vitaminähnlicher Lebensmittelinhaltsstoff für den Menschen mit besonderer Bedeutung für den Lichtschutz.
Als vergleichsweise schwaches Antioxidans kann Zeaxanthin durch die stärkeren antioxidativen Nährstoffe bzw. körpereigenen Antioxidantien – z. B. die Thiole Glutathion, Cystein und Liponsäure - teilweise gegen Oxidation geschützt werden.
Umgekehrt gibt es Hinweise, dass eine hohe Zufuhr von Carotinoiden wie Zeaxanthin auch einen positiven Einfluss auf den Status bei den anderen körpereigenen Antioxidantien hat.
Hohe Mengen an Zeaxanthin sollten aus theoretischen Erwägungen wegen der erforderlichen Regeneration durch die körpereigenen antioxidativen Schutzsysteme zusammen mit anderen antioxidativen Nährstoffen supplementiert werden. Das gilt insbesondere für Personen mit erfahrungsgemäß schlechtem antioxidativem Status (z. B. Raucher, Diabetiker).
Zeaxanthin ist ein effizienter Fänger von freien Radikalen.
Nach der antioxidativen Rangordnung der Carotinoide wird Zeaxanthin im Auge erst nach Vitamin E, ß-Carorin, Lycopin und Lutein verbraucht.–Zeaxanthin ist für das Auge wahrscheinlich die letzte Sicherung gegen oxidative Schäden.
Die natürlich besonders hohe Konzentration von Zeaxanthin in der Netzhautmitte (dem Ort des schärfsten Sehens) spricht für eine besonders wichtige Schutzfunktion beim Schutz der Sehfähigkeit.
